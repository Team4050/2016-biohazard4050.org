	"bio": "After earning a Bachelors Degree in Writing from Geneva College and working for a half dozen years as a book editor for McGraw-Hill, John continued his education, obtaining a Masters Degree in Computer Science from Shippensburg University. In 1998, while wrapping up his degree, John began working in the IT Division at Gettysburg College as a Programmer/Analyst, a position he continues to hold. John's introduction to the Biohazard team came in the Fall of 2015 when his son, Jaden, joined the team. While John remained diligent in taking Jaden to club meetings, it wasnt until several weeks into the the build season that he started to become engaged with the team. He saw how Jaden had been embraced by the team and was growing in skills, responsibility, and confidence as he worked as a part of the mechanical team. When he and his family traveled with the team to the Greater Pittsburgh Regional, Biohazard's first competition of the 2016 season, John saw the enthusiasm and camaraderie of the team and the excitement of the competition and was hooked. After competition season wrapped up, John became a part of the team as a mentor for the programming team.",

Last year I was happy to see our strategy brought us up a level.  We moved to 14th place and one of the top 10 individual scores.  This put us into the team 8 captain position, where before we were 3rd draft choice. The Strategy team determined the defenses would be the best way to score and we were the number one team at the defenses at competitions.  We also drove for more practice time and gave our drivers an advantage with the defenses.  This year, with focus, I see no reason why we can't be in the top 10 and looking at that number one positon.
