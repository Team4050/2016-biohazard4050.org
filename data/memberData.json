When people ask me why I enjoy the being a part of this Team, I tell them that 1.  This has been a place where I can connect with people.  It's my niche. 2.  I'm competitive, but I've never been good at Sports.  They call FIRST the \"Sport for the Mind\" and I must agree.  I can exert my competitiveness in an environment that interests me.  Personally, I'm a Cyber-schooled (yeah, one of those people) High-schooled Senior.  I enjoy watching sports, (and playing the occasional pickup game) eating food, and I work on a local farm.  (I also like to use parenthesis when I type).  So yeah, that's my bio.  Hope you enjoyed."
