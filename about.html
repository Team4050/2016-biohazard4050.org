                    FIRST Robotics Competition Team “Biohazard” 4050 is the high-school division of the Franklin County
                    4-H Robotics Club. Since 2012, Team 4050 has provided local students with the opportunity to
                    participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition program. In the 2015-2016 season, Team 4050 was host
                    to over 25 students, from 3 states, guided by over a dozen mentors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The focal point of Team 4050’s existence is participation in FIRST Robotics Competition. Each year,
                    members and mentors work together to design and build a unique robot. In January, FIRST releases the
                    annual “Game” that they must design their robot to participate in. To add to the challenge, they are
                    given only 6 weeks to complete the robot. In the ensuing months, they attend two regional
                    competitions, where they compete against 50+ other Teams, each with their own unique robot. Teams
                    who win a regional are given the opportunity to attend a Championship event, where they compete for
                    best in the world.
                </p>
                <p>In 2015, the FRC Team won the Chesapeake Regional competition and had the opportunity to go to the
                    World Championship, a huge milestone and a major accomplishment.</p>

                        Our fifth year began our new approach to the build season. After heavy strategizing, we
                        created a game plan for our new robot, “Dialga – The Steel Dragon”. Continuing in our
                        tradition of building a practice robot, we continued to design
                        and build after the conclusion of our build season. We attended the Pittsburgh Regional and
                        nearly won the entire event after making it into the finals. After making further
                        improvements, we went to the Smoky Mountain Regional and made
                        it to the quarter-finals. We walked away with a beautiful silver metal and the Quality
                        Award.

                        With our fourth year came experience and a routine schedule. We built our towering
                        “Anonymous” who stacked totes and recycling containers. After a disappointing appearance at
                        the Pittsburgh Regional, we made modifications and had the opportunity
                        to go to the Chesapeake Regional again. While there, we were selected by the top ranked
                        alliance and won the event! This allowed us to go to the World Championship in St. Louis for
                        the first time in our existence. We had an amazing time.

                        Biohazard had grown even more, beginning an efficient scouting program and improving our
                        build strategy. Our robot, “Toxic Lepra-Khan,” was by far our most beautiful robot thus far.
                        This was the first year we built an identical robot for
                        practice purposes. We then attended the Pittsburgh Regional—while there, we made the
                        playoffs and won the Excellence in Engineering Award. Overall, a successful season.

                        Biohazard 4050 was the new start for our team, with a new name and image. After growing our
                        team significantly in numbers—by both members and mentors—we engaged in our second season.
                        Six weeks of intense prototyping, building, and testing
                        ensued before we and our robot, “Total Meltdown,” attended the Pittsburgh and Chesapeake
                        Regionals, finishing in the playoffs in both events. We had greatly improved since our start
                        a year before.

                        Tech Team Franklin began their six-week build period late, with only ten members and a
                        handful of mentors. After consistent meetings and training in electrical, mechanical, and
                        programming, our robot “Genesis” was born. We attended the Pittsburgh
                        Regional and, after a successful learning experience, began preparing for a new year.
